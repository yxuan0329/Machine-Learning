# HW2: Naive Bayes Classifier and Online Learning

## 2.1 Naive Bayes Classifier

#### Discrete 



#### Continuous

- By calculating mean and variance, we can get the likelihood function according to Gaussian distribution. 
- Posterior = Prior * Likelihood / Marginal



- Problem: How to make the error rate lower?
  - If the ratio of data variance between dimensions is too small, it will cause numerical errors. We can boost the variance by epsilon (a small fraction).
